## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.7 Runtime Events Display Hygiene and Clear Recent Events

- Purpose: Fix runtime events display (too noisy with full tracebacks) and add one-click clear button.
- Key files: `runtime_events/service.py` (+`clear_recent_events()`), `control_panel_web_service.py` (+`clear_runtime_events` API), `frontend/*` (compact text + clear button).
- Last completed:
  1. `clear_recent_events()` public function in runtime_events service — clears in-memory ring, returns count removed. Does NOT touch files.
  2. `ControlPanelWebApi.clear_runtime_events()` API — calls `clear_recent_events()`, records a runtime event for the action, returns `{ok, data: {removed}}`.
  3. Frontend `compactRuntimeEventText()` truncates at 110 chars and strips Traceback suffix; `renderRuntimeEvents` renders to both Diagnostics page and Home drawer with summary-only display.
  4. "清空事件" button on Diagnostics page in the 运行事件 card, with loading state and success/failure toast.
  5. CSS max-height (280px) and `overflow-y:auto` on events lists; single-line `text-overflow:ellipsis` on entries.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (926 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: `clear_runtime_events` records its own event (one event remains after clear); constructor's `init_event_logger` may load from disk JSONL.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.5 Chat Focus Mode Remove Redundant Header Chrome

- Purpose: Put Chat into focus mode by removing the two remaining top chrome layers only on the Chat page.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Added `body.chat-page .topbar{display:none!important}` so the global command bar is hidden only in Chat.
  2. Added Chat-specific app-shell grid overrides so no topbar row/blank space remains, including sidebar-collapsed combinations.
  3. Added `body.chat-page #section-chat .text-chat-header{display:none!important}` so the “对话 / 说明 / 本地文本入口” row is hidden in focus mode.
  4. Kept Chat message surface, right session rail, composer, internal scroll, sidebar collapse, and non-home drawer hiding intact.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (917 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; pywebview startup smoke stayed alive for 6s; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (38 tests).
- Known traps: Topbar must remain present in HTML and visible outside Chat; focus mode is CSS-scoped to `body.chat-page`.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.4 Minimal Spacious Chat Surface Polish

- Purpose: Reduce stacked chrome and make Chat feel quieter, lighter, and more spacious without changing behavior.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Chat header copy shortened and CSS compressed the header to a compact inline surface with a smaller status chip.
  2. Topbar chrome was thinned: smaller logo, tighter chips/buttons, lighter shadow/border, calmer command-bar feel.
  3. Welcome message shortened; first assistant bubble is styled as a soft system message instead of a heavy banner.
  4. Composer and prompt chips were tightened; the model pill is hidden on Chat to reduce repeated metadata; right session rail is lighter and remains present.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (916 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; pywebview startup smoke stayed alive for 6s; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (37 tests).
- Known traps: Keep Chat internal scrolling, sidebar collapse, non-home drawer hiding, and right-side session rail intact; this is visual weight reduction only.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.3 Chat Right Utility Rail and Collapsible Sidebar

- Purpose: Move Chat's session helper rail to the right side and add persistent collapsible primary sidebar for more workspace room.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Chat DOM/layout now places `text-chat-main` before `text-chat-sessions`, with grid `messages + right session rail` (`minmax(0,1fr) minmax(250px,300px)`).
  2. Added sidebar toggle button (`btn-sidebar-toggle`) and icon/text nav items with titles for collapsed hover context.
  3. Added `SIDEBAR_STORAGE_KEY`, `initSidebarControls()`, and `sidebar-collapsed` body state persisted in localStorage.
  4. CSS covers expanded/collapsed sidebar grids for Home, Home with collapsed drawer rail, and non-home pages; Chat internal scroll and non-home drawer hiding remain intact.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (915 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip; one ResourceWarning printed but tests passed); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; pywebview startup smoke stayed alive for 6s; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (36 tests).
- Known traps: DOM order matters for right-side Chat sessions; collapsed sidebar grid rules must remain compatible with `non-home-page` and `drawer-collapsed`.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.2 Chat Scroll Container and Non-Home Drawer Cleanup

- Purpose: Fix follow-up App Shell acceptance issues — no non-home diagnostic rail residue, and Chat messages must scroll inside the chat card instead of growing the window.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. `updateShellLayoutForSection()` now also toggles `home-page`, `non-home-page`, and `chat-page` while keeping previous `drawer-page` / `no-drawer-page` compatibility.
  2. Non-home CSS hides diagnostic drawer, rail, and any drawer toggle, including the collapsed rail override path.
  3. Chat page has fixed-height section rules (`height:100%`, `min-height:0`) and `body.chat-page .main-workspace{overflow:hidden}` so messages cannot stretch the whole page.
  4. Chat message list has internal `overflow-y:auto`, `overscroll-behavior:contain`, and `scrollTextChatToBottom()` is used after rendering.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (914 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; pywebview startup smoke stayed alive for 6s; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (35 tests).
- Known traps: The generic `.app-shell.drawer-collapsed .drawer-rail{display:flex}` rule must stay overridden for non-home pages; do not remove `min-height:0` from chat ancestors.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0.1 Context Panel Scope and Chat Space Polish

- Purpose: Fix the first App Shell layout issue where the right diagnostic context panel crowded every page, especially Chat.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Added `updateShellLayoutForSection()` so `home` gets `drawer-page`; all other primary pages get `no-drawer-page`.
  2. CSS now removes the right diagnostic drawer/rail from non-home pages and expands the shell to sidebar + main workspace without leaving blank space.
  3. Top “诊断” button is now a Diagnostics page entry (`open-diagnostics`) instead of a drawer collapse control; Home still keeps drawer collapse/rail controls.
  4. Chat layout is two columns (`sessions + messages`) and the right `text-chat-workspace` column is hidden to give message/composer space back.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK after one unrelated flaky diagnostic-export filename collision was rerun cleanly (913 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; pywebview startup smoke stayed alive for 6s; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (34 tests).
- Known traps: Keep the drawer localStorage collapse behavior only for Home; do not re-add a global right drawer to Chat/Tasks/Tools/Diagnostics/Settings.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-10）— V1.5-UI0 App Shell Layout Foundation

- Purpose: Reframe the control panel frontend as a durable App Shell with Top Bar / fixed primary Sidebar / Main Workspace / right Context Panel.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Sidebar now exposes only six primary pages: 首页 / 对话 / 任务 / 工具 / 诊断 / 设置.
  2. Chat is a normal primary workspace page (`section-chat`), not a separate full-window `text-chat-shell`; top “文本对话” remains as a shortcut into the same Chat page via `switchShell('text-chat')`.
  3. Home keeps runtime cards and quick actions; Settings contains wake/voice controls and wake detail rows; Diagnostics keeps event/export affordances; Tasks/Tools are safe placeholders only.
  4. Frontend feedback tightened with button active/focus/loading states and capped toast stacking.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (910 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK; targeted `V13UIFrontendStructureTests` OK (31 tests).
- Known traps: Do not reintroduce old sidebar categories as primary nav; `switchSection()` keeps aliases for old section ids so legacy JS calls land on the new pages; no backend/API/text interaction service changes were made.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D5.1 Readonly Review Safety Fixes

- Purpose: Fix two D5 issues — real sensitive field redaction in log details, and config_path propagation from control panel to config summary.
- Key files: `text_task_execution_service.py`, `control_panel_web_service.py`, tests.
- Last completed:
  1. Added `_redact_sensitive_text()` helper with 3 regex patterns covering: `api_key=xxx`, `token=xxx`, `password=xxx`, `secret=xxx`, `authorization=xxx`, `Bearer xxx` (case-insensitive). Applied BEFORE truncation in `_analyze_recent_logs()` detail_lines.
  2. Added optional `config_path` parameter to `execute_confirmed_text_task()` and `_execute_readonly_config_summary()`; `control_panel_web_service.confirm_text_task` now passes `self._resolve_config_path()`.
  3. Fixed old redaction test to use log lines containing error/warning/failed keywords (so they actually get sampled into detail_lines), proving redaction works. Tests use: `ERROR api_key=sk-..., WARNING token=abc123, FAILED password=..., etc.`
  4. Added config_path execution test (temp custom config) + ControlPanel API-level test (ControlPanelWebApi passes config_path through).
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (909 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +3 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: None config_path uses default config; redaction is regex-based, covers common formats but not exhaustive; don't add new task types or keywords.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D5 More Readonly Task Types

- Purpose: Add 3 new safe readonly task types — recent errors review, runtime events review, and config summary — extending the existing confirm → execute → result card pipeline.
- Key files: `text_task_intent_service.py` (new term sets), `text_task_execution_service.py` (3 new handlers + whitelist), `tests/` (intent + execution + control panel API tests).
- Last completed:
  1. `readonly_recent_errors_review` — keyword detection (最近错误/报错/异常 etc.), reads logs safety (reuses existing helpers), redacts sensitive values, handles empty logs directory gracefully
  2. `readonly_runtime_events_review` — keyword detection (最近事件/运行事件/运行记录 etc.), calls `get_recent_events()`, aggregates by source/type, counts errors/warnings, handles empty events gracefully, does NOT clear ring buffer
  3. `readonly_config_summary` — keyword detection (当前配置/配置摘要 etc.), calls `load_config()`, outputs human-readable summary (LLM/TTS/wake/STT/conversation/overlay/runtime), shows env var name (not value), no API keys/secrets/passwords
  4. All 3 types follow the existing pipeline: intent → pending_task → registry → confirm (task_id only) → execute → result card
- Detection order: blocked_local_execution > recent_errors_review > log_analysis > status_check > diagnostic_review > runtime_events_review > config_summary
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (906 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +13 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: _RECENT_ERRORS_TERMS before _LOG_TERMS in detection order (overlap on "报错"); config summary reads default config in tests (no user config); events review reads from memory ring.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-Q3.1 Capability Router Risk Pattern Normalization Hardening

- Purpose: Fix high-risk pattern matching — patterns with spaces ("rm -", "del ", "format ") were not matching normalized user input, causing dangerous requests to potentially bypass the deny check. Now all pattern matching uses the same `_normalize_command_text` helper.
- Key files: `src/xiaohuang/capabilities/local_commands/service.py`, `tests/test_capability_router.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. Added `_normalize_command_text()` helper: `str(text or "").replace(" ", "").lower()`
  2. Applied to all three matching loops: high-risk patterns, whitelist keywords, denied keywords — all normalize both the input AND the pattern/keyword
  3. Whitelist matching now records the actual matched keyword (not just `keywords[0]`)
  4. 7 new tests: rm/del/format space patterns properly denied, whitelist regression, high-risk priority over whitelist, normal chat regression
- Behavior: "rm -rf", "del file.txt", "format c:" (and case/spacing variants) now correctly detected as `not_allowed`; all existing whitelist keywords still work; high-risk check still takes priority over whitelist; normal chat unaffected.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (893 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +7 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not add new keywords or patterns; this is normalization hardening only.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-Q3 Capability Router Test Coverage

- Purpose: Extend capability router test coverage — normalization, route/execute separation, disabled capability, risk labels, refusal messages, and runtime event recording.
- Key files: `tests/test_capability_router.py` (extended, +15 tests, now 51 total).
- Last completed: 7 new test classes:
  - `RouteCapabilityNormalizationTests` (5) — whitespace trimming, internal spaces, case folding with Chinese-English mix, whitespace-only not_task
  - `RouteVsExecuteSeparationTests` (1) — `route_capability` does NOT call capability handlers, only returns decisions
  - `DisabledCapabilityTests` (1) — disabled cap routes as `capability_disabled` with its name in message
  - `CapabilityRiskLabelTests` (2) — all 5 core caps are `low` risk + have all required fields
  - `RefusalMessageContentTests` (2) — high-risk and denied keyword messages contain "白名单"
  - `CapabilityRuntimeEventsTests` (2) — successful execution records `capability_invoked` + `capability_completed`; handler exception records `capability_failed`
  - `NotTaskEdgeCaseTests` (2) — chat-like texts are not_task; keyword embedded in sentence still detected
- Key observations: normalization only removes spaces and lowercases input text, does NOT normalize keyword strings; pure English "OPEN LOGS" won't match Chinese-containing keywords; keywords with internal spaces (like "rm -") won't match normalized input because spaces are stripped from input but not keywords.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (886 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +15 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not add new keywords or capabilities; do not change normalization logic; route_capability is pure decision, not execution.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-Q2 Runtime Events Test Coverage

- Purpose: Extend runtime events test coverage — blank/empty edge cases, leveled events, details JSON-friendliness, ControlPanelWebApi exposure, and capability router event recording.
- Key files: `tests/test_runtime_events_service.py` (extended, +17 tests, now 38 total).
- Last completed: 5 new test classes:
  - `LevelPreservationTests` (4) — info/warning/error/default level preserved
  - `BlankSourceOrTypeTests` (3) — empty string source/event_type/message accepted as-is
  - `DetailsEdgeCaseTests` (5) — None/empty dict details, JSON-friendly complex dicts, nested sensitive field filtering
  - `ControlPanelRuntimeEventsApiTests` (2) — `get_runtime_events()` returns ok with events, response is JSON-serializable
  - `CapabilityEventRecordingTests` (2) — `get_status` and `export_diagnostics` capabilities record `capability_router` events
- Key observations: `get_recent_events` returns oldest-first (FIFO), not newest-first; there is no public `clear_events` function; empty strings are stored as-is; system unchanged.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (871 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +17 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: no clear/reset API — use `svc._ring.clear()` for test isolation; ring buffer max 200, limit clamped to [1,100]; empty strings for source/type are stored as empty strings, not "unknown".

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-Q1 App Config Service Test Coverage

- Purpose: Dedicated test suite for `app_config_service.py` — lock down config loading, merging, coercion, CLI override, and frozen dataclass behavior.
- Key files: `tests/test_app_config_service.py` (new, 41 tests).
- Last completed: 5 test classes covering default config, load_config (missing/invalid/non-object/valid), merge_config_dict (non-object section skip), wake phrases/aliases (string/list/empty/invalid), numeric out-of-range fallback, bool coercion (type-strict), assistant overrides, LLM/TTS/overlay field merge, apply_cli_overrides (scalar values, store_true semantics, None passthrough, CLI True overrides config False), and frozen dataclass behavior.
- Behavior: all existing app_config_service functions unchanged; tests verify current behavior as-is.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (854 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip, +41 new); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: `_coerce_bool` accepts only `bool` type, not strings; `_or_config` False means "not passed"; list fields inside frozen dataclass are still mutable in-place.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D4.1 Registry Edge Hardening / UX Polish

- Purpose: Small security and UX patch over D4 — prevent tasks stuck in executing, friendly blocked reason text, natural expiry label.
- Key files: `control_panel_web_service.py`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed:
  1. `confirm_text_task` wraps execution in inner try/except; unexpected exceptions after claim now call `mark_failed` and return `_registry_failed_result` instead of leaving task stuck in `executing`.
  2. `_registry_reason_text` maps 7 internal reason codes to friendly Chinese summary/details; `_registry_blocked_result` calls it; `error` field still preserves raw reason code.
  3. Frontend `formatTaskExpiryLabel` computes remaining time from `expires_at` / `expires_in_seconds` and shows "约 N 分钟内有效" (or "N 秒内有效" for < 60s), replacing the old raw seconds inline format.
- Behavior: normal completed/blocked/failed result flow unchanged; normal task execution not affected by the new try/except; frontend still sends only `task_id`.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (813 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: keep this as edge hardening only; do not add new task types, execution capabilities, or modify `text_task_execution_service.py`.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D4 Pending Task Registry / Server-side Task Store

- Purpose: Pending text tasks are stored server-side; confirmation now trusts only registry task IDs, not frontend task payloads.
- Key files: `text_task_registry_models.py`, `text_task_registry_service.py`, `control_panel_web_service.py`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`.
- Last completed: added in-memory registry with TTL/capacity/status transitions, registered pending tasks on `send_text_message`, changed confirm to `task_id`, and added `cancel_text_task`.
- Behavior: unknown, expired, repeated, cancelled, or forged pending task confirmations return blocked registry-compatible result cards.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (803 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: keep registry in memory only; do not add persistence, new task types, generic execution, `local_commands`, or database access.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D3.1 Readonly Task Result Card UI

- Purpose: Render confirmed readonly task execution results as structured cards instead of plain assistant text.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed: execution result messages now carry `executionResult`, render completed/blocked/failed cards, and show summary, details, read files, and error code.
- Behavior: `confirm_text_task` call and pending task card logic stay unchanged; result display is frontend-only.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (789 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not modify backend execution, task types, `confirm_text_task`, or any local command capability from this UI task.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D3.0.1 Log Symlink Safety Hardening

- Purpose: Harden readonly log selection so confirmed text tasks cannot follow log symlinks outside `logs/`.
- Key files: `text_task_execution_service.py`, `tests/test_text_task_execution_service.py`.
- Last completed: `_recent_log_files()` now skips symlinks, checks resolved path containment under `logs/`, isolates per-file errors, and uses safe mtime sorting.
- Behavior: normal `.log` and `.txt` files under `logs/` are still read; symlinked log files are skipped.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (787 tests, 1 symlink-permission skip); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: keep this as log selection hardening only; do not change frontend, ControlPanel API, task types, or execution capability.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D3 Confirmed Readonly Task Execution

- Purpose: Confirmed text task cards can now call a backend API that executes only whitelisted readonly tasks.
- Key files: `text_task_execution_models.py`, `text_task_execution_service.py`, `control_panel_web_service.py`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`.
- Last completed: added `confirm_text_task`, readonly log/status/diagnostic execution, backend re-validation, and frontend executing/completed/blocked/failed states.
- Behavior: only `readonly_log_analysis`, `readonly_status_check`, and `readonly_diagnostic_review` can run; blocked/high-risk/unknown tasks return structured blocked results.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (785 tests); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not add generic `execute_text_task`, do not call `local_commands`, subprocess, PowerShell, cmd, or write/export diagnostics from this path.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D1.1.1 Text Task Card Field Mapping Fix

- Purpose: Align the text task confirmation card with the D1 backend field names.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed: card risk now prefers `pending_task.risk_level` before `risk`, clamps unknown risks to medium, and shows optional `original_text` as “原始输入”.
- Behavior: confirm/cancel still only update frontend state and append local assistant feedback; no backend execution path was added.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK after rerun (773 tests; first run hit existing diagnostic export timestamp collision); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: keep this as UI-only mapping; do not connect card actions to task execution or `local_commands`.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D1.1 Text Task Confirmation Card UI

- Purpose: Text chat renders backend `pending_task` responses as an in-window confirmation card without executing the task.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed: pending tasks now show title, summary, risk, status, and local confirm/cancel controls inside the full-window text chat.
- Behavior: confirm/cancel only updates frontend message state and appends a local assistant note; no new backend API or command execution path is added.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (773 tests); control_panel_web `--help` OK; voice_overlay `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not wire card buttons to task execution until the confirmed readonly execution contract exists; avoid `local_commands` from frontend code.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-D1 Text Task Confirmation Backend Contract

- Purpose: Text chat can detect local task intent and return a structured `pending_task` that requires confirmation, without executing anything.
- Key files: `text_task_models.py`, `text_task_intent_service.py`, `text_task_confirmation_service.py`, `text_interaction_models.py`, `text_interaction_service.py`.
- Last completed: deterministic intent detection for readonly log/status/diagnostic review and blocked local execution.
- Behavior: panel command guard still wins; task intents return `requires_confirmation=True`, `reply_source=pending_task`, and no reply runtime call.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (771 tests); control_panel_web `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: D1 is contract only; do not call `local_commands.execute_capability`, write DB/files, or add frontend confirmation UI here.
- Next likely edit points: V1.4-D2 frontend confirmation card UI, V1.4-D3 confirmed readonly execution.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-C.3 Remove Text Chat From Control Sidebar

- Purpose: Keep text chat as a full-window mode entered only from the top control button, not a sidebar category.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed: removed `data-section="text-chat"` from the control sidebar; top `data-action="open-text-chat"` still switches to `text-chat-shell`.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (759 tests); control_panel_web `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: do not re-add text chat to the control navigation; frontend must not call `open_text_chat_window`.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-C.2 Fullscreen Text Chat Mode

- Purpose: Make text chat a full-window mode inside the same pywebview app, not a module inside control center.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `tests/test_control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Last completed: `control-shell` and `text-chat-shell` are top-level siblings; text mode hides control nav/topbar/diagnostic drawer.
- Behavior: top button and left nav switch to `text-chat-shell`; `btn-back-control` returns to control shell.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (759 tests after rerun); control_panel/voice_overlay/text_chat `--help` OK; diff check OK.
- Known traps: frontend must not call `open_text_chat_window`; keep using `send_text_message` / `clear_text_session`.
- Next likely edit points: visual click-through QA in pywebview, legacy standalone removal, task confirmation flow.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-C.1 Single Shell UI

- Purpose: Merge control center and text chat into one pywebview control panel window.
- Key files: `frontend/control_panel/index.html`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/app.js`, `frontend/control_panel/assets/style.css`, `src/xiaohuang/control_panel_web_service.py`.
- Startup/test: `F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe scripts\control_panel_web.py`; text chat is selected inside the same shell.
- Last completed: left nav/top button switch to `section-text-chat`; ControlPanelWebApi exposes `send_text_message` and `clear_text_session`.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK (759 tests); control_panel/voice_overlay/text_chat `--help` OK; same-window API smoke OK.
- Known traps: `open_text_chat_window` intentionally returns `{same_window: True}` and must not launch `scripts/text_chat_web.py`.
- Next likely edit points: remove legacy standalone text chat after manual acceptance, add temporary multi-session list, add text task confirmation.

## Current Snapshot（2026-05-09）— V1.4-C Standalone Text Chat Window

- Purpose: Add a second user entry for typed XiaoHuang conversations without touching voice/STT/TTS startup.
- Key files: `scripts/text_chat_web.py`, `frontend/text_chat/*`, `src/xiaohuang/text_interaction_*`, `src/xiaohuang/text_chat_web_service.py`, control panel open button/API.
- Startup/test: `F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe scripts\text_chat_web.py`; control panel opens it through `open_text_chat_window`.
- Behavior: in-process short-term `ConversationMemory` only; no database, no long-term chat files, no mic/STT/openWakeWord/TTS.
- Guard: panel control phrases return `reply_source=panel_command_guard` and `blocked_panel_command=True`.
- Verification: compileall OK; unittest discover OK; text_chat/control_panel/voice_overlay `--help` OK; guard smoke OK.
- Known traps: text entry deliberately bypasses capability execution by using a text-only reply pipeline function.
- Next likely edit points: temporary multi-session UI, text task confirmation flow, shared voice/text task routing.

## RTK onboarding snapshot（2026-05-06）

- Purpose: Windows 桌面语音助手；当前真实代码已超过 README 的 V1.2E，处在 V1.3 UI / overlay dock 与 Web 控制面板迭代后状态。
- Key entry points: `scripts/voice_overlay.py`（PySide6 透明音波 dock + runtime 组装）、`scripts/stt_server.py`、`scripts/control_panel.py`、`scripts/control_panel_web.py`、`scripts/tray_app.py`。
- Runtime boundaries: `voice_overlay.py` 不再承载主循环业务；主循环在 `overlay_loop_runtime_service.py`，wake 在 `wake_runtime_service.py` / `openwakeword_adapter.py`，command 在 `command_runtime_service.py`，reply/session 在 `reply_runtime_service.py` / `assistant_runtime_service.py`。
- UI surfaces: Tk 控制面板仍在 `scripts/control_panel.py`；pywebview 控制面板通过 `control_panel_web_service.py` + `frontend/control_panel/*`；voice overlay 已替换为 `voice_overlay_qt_ui.py` 的 PySide6 透明音波 dock，旧 `frontend/voice_overlay/*` 原型资产已删除。
- Startup/test: 先 dot-source `.\scripts\run_env.ps1`；Python 固定用 `F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe`。
- Baseline verification on 2026-05-06: `unittest discover -s tests -q` 535 tests OK；`compileall -q src scripts tests` OK；`scripts\voice_overlay.py --help` OK。
- Git state on 2026-05-06: `main...origin/main` ahead 10；untracked `.claude/` and `overlay_ui_context.txt` only; no tracked diff before this memory note.
- Known trap: `README.md` and `run_env.ps1` text are stale in places; prefer `AGENTS.md`, this memory, git log, and actual files.
- Known trap: `overlay_ui_context.txt` is an old UI snapshot and differs from current `scripts/voice_overlay.py`; do not restore from it blindly.
- Hard boundaries still active: no API key in config/docs/logs/code/commit messages, no writes to `E:\DataBase`, no new god manager/controller, no broad refactor unless explicitly scoped.

### V1.3-Overlay-UI-E PySide6 overlay dock（2026-05-06）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/voice_overlay_qt_ui.py`（427 行）：PySide6 frameless/topmost/tool 透明窗口，QPainterPath 多层音波，Qt Signal bridge 保证 worker thread 更新 UI 安全。
- `scripts/voice_overlay.py` 从 Tkinter/Pillow 音波实现缩减到 374 行入口/组装；保留 `VoiceOverlayApp` re-export 和 wake runtime 测试兼容常量。
- 删除未引用的 `frontend/voice_overlay/*` HTML prototype 资产；`frontend/control_panel/*` 和 Web 控制面板不变。
- `requirements.txt` 新增 `PySide6>=6.11.0`；未新增其他 GUI 依赖。
- 验证：`voice_overlay.py --help` OK；`compileall -q src scripts tests` OK；`unittest discover -s tests` 539 tests OK；有界 Qt preview smoke 自动打开/关闭，`stop_event_set=True`。

- 控制面板显示当前 `wake.engine`、是否默认 `stt_text`、`fallback_enabled`、`device_index`、`cooldown_seconds`、`sensitivity` 和 openWakeWord label 提示。
- 控制面板新增最小 Wake Engine 配置区：`stt_text` / `openwakeword` 下拉、fallback 勾选、device/cooldown/sensitivity 输入框。
- 保存逻辑在 `status_control_service.save_wake_engine_config()`，只改 `wake.engine`、`fallback_enabled`、`device_index`、`cooldown_seconds`、`sensitivity`，保留其他 JSON 字段。
- 配置文件不存在、非法 device/cooldown/sensitivity 会提示错误，不创建错误路径。
- 保存后提示需要重启；“保存并重启小黄”复用控制面板现有 `run_restart_operation()`。
- 本阶段未修改 `voice_overlay.py` / openWakeWord adapter / wake bridge / PowerShell / requirements，也不打开麦克风或启动 openWakeWord。

### V1.2F-B wake_runtime_service 抽取记录（2026-05-04）

- 新建 `src/xiaohuang/wake_runtime_service.py`：`WAKE_ENGINE_STT_TEXT`/`OPENWAKEWORD`、`WakeEngineRuntimeConfig`/`Plan`、`normalize_wake_engine()`、`build_wake_engine_runtime_config()`、`select_wake_engine_runtime()`、`format_openwakeword_dependency_error()`。

- 本阶段未改 openWakeWord adapter / wake bridge / wake engine / PowerShell / E:\DataBase，不打开麦克风。

### V1.2F-C openWakeWord listener 迁移记录（2026-05-04）

- `wake_runtime_service.py` 扩展：新增 `OpenWakeWordListenerHandle`、`OpenWakeWordBridgeRuntime`（线程安全 bridge）、`create_openwakeword_adapter()`、listener 生命周期函数（`start/run/stop/wait/handle/log`）、辅助函数（`stop_adapter_safely`/`wake_engine_runtime_error`/`_safe_print`/`_log_runtime_message`/`_bool_text`）、`WakeEngineLoopStopped`/`WakeEngineRuntimeError` 异常、`OPENWAKEWORD_QUEUE_POLL_SECONDS`/`OPENWAKEWORD_STATUS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`。

- 未改 openWakeWord adapter / wake bridge / control_panel / PowerShell / E:\DataBase，不打开麦克风。

### V1.2E continuous openWakeWord listener 修复记录（2026-05-04）

- blocker 现象：`voice_overlay.py` 能打印 `openwakeword_listener_starting/running`，但随后持续 `frames=11 raw=0`，用户说 “hey jarvis” 无唤醒；独立 `wake_engine_demo.py --duration-seconds 20 --debug` 仍可输出 wake_event。
- 新根因：overlay listener 每 1 秒反复 `adapter.run_for_duration()`，每轮重开 stream 并重置 coalescer/模型相关上下文，实际只有 10-11 frames，不等价于独立 demo 的连续监听。
- 修复：`OpenWakeWordAdapter` 新增 `run_until_stopped(stop_event, ...)`，一次 start、一次打开 sounddevice input stream，循环读取直到 stop_event；模型对象保持常驻，stream 在连续监听期间保持打开，finally 释放。
- `voice_overlay.py` 后台 listener thread 改为调用 `run_until_stopped()`；不再按秒刷 `openwakeword_listener_cycle_done`，改为周期性 `openwakeword_listener_status`，包含 device、sample_rate、sensitivity、model_labels、frames、max_label、max_score 和 raw/coalesced/suppressed。
- command recording / TTS active 仍由 bridge 拒绝 wake event，但不再通过 `adapter.stop()` 杀掉连续 listener。
- 单测新增/更新：fake adapter 的 `run_until_stopped` 被调用且 `run_for_duration` 不被 overlay listener 调用；真实 adapter fake stream 验证 `run_until_stopped` 只打开一个 stream 并能上报 model labels / max score；fake event 仍进入 command recorder。

### V1.2E openWakeWord listener 修复记录（2026-05-04）

- 根因：上一版 `voice_overlay.py` 的 openWakeWord 集成仍在 overlay turn loop 里同步创建 adapter 并短时 `run_for_duration()`，没有 overlay-owned background listener 生命周期，导致主程序隔离测试中缺少 listener startup/running/error/cycle 日志，且不够明确证明 listener 持续运行。
- 修复：`voice_overlay.py` 在 `wake.engine=openwakeword` 时创建 daemon listener thread；listener 持续按短窗口循环调用 adapter，把 accepted `WakeEvent` 通过 Queue 投递给 overlay worker。
- accepted event 进入统一 command recorder：overlay worker 从 queue 取事件后调用旧 VAD command recording + STT command 入口，不新增残缺命令流程。
- 日志新增/规范：`wake_engine_selected`、`wake_fallback_enabled`、`wake_device_index`、`wake_cooldown_seconds`、`wake_sensitivity`、`openwakeword_listener_starting`、`openwakeword_listener_running`、`openwakeword_listener_cycle_done`、`openwakeword_listener_error`、`fallback_to_stt_text`、`openwakeword_wake_event`、`openwakeword_bridge_decision`、`command_record_start source=openwakeword`。
- command recording 和 TTS 播放期间通过 bridge state 暂停/屏蔽 openWakeWord event；退出时 stop listener / adapter。
- 单测新增 fake adapter 覆盖 listener thread 启动、连续循环、不打开真实麦克风的 accepted event queue handoff、command/tts active 抑制、listener error fallback 和 fallback disabled safe stop。
- 未修改 PowerShell、requirements、`E:\DataBase`；未下载模型；未训练模型。

### V1.2E openWakeWord feature flag 接入记录（2026-05-04）

- `wake.engine` 默认仍是 `stt_text`；新增 `openwakeword` 仅在 JSON 显式配置后启用，`fallback_enabled=true` 时依赖/运行失败回退旧 STT 文本唤醒。
- `app_config_service.WakeConfig` 新增 `engine`、`fallback_enabled`、`sensitivity`、`cooldown_seconds`、`device_index`、`model_path`、`model_name`。
- `voice_overlay.py` 新增 openWakeWord runtime selection；收到 coalesced `WakeEvent` 后经 `WakeCommandBridge` accepted，先 stop adapter，再进入旧 VAD command recorder。
- command record 期间标记 `command_active`；TTS pipeline 用 guarded callback 标记 `tts_active`，用于屏蔽 wake event 和自唤醒风险。
- openWakeWord adapter runtime error 且 fallback 开启时只回退本轮到 `stt_text`；fallback 关闭时显示错误并保持安全状态。
- 新增 fake 单测覆盖默认旧路径、openwakeword 选择、依赖失败 fallback/error、accepted event 只启动一次 command recorder、command/tts active reject、录音异常后 adapter stopped + command inactive。
- 未修改 PowerShell、requirements、`E:\DataBase`、secrets/logs/audio/model cache；未下载模型；未训练中文“贾维斯”模型。
- 人工验证：先测默认/`stt_text` 旧“贾维斯”，再配 `wake.engine=openwakeword` + device 0 后说 “hey jarvis”，最后改回 `stt_text` 回滚。

### V1.2D-C Wake Command Bridge simulation 记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/wake_command_bridge_service.py`：`WakeBridgeDecision`、`WakeCommandBridgeConfig`、`WakeCommandBridgeState`、`WakeCommandBridge`、`FakeCommandStarter`。
- bridge 只接收 `WakeEvent` 并调用注入的 fake command starter；不打开麦克风、不启动 openWakeWord/STT/voice_overlay/LLM/TTS。
- 状态机覆盖 `accepted`、`disabled`、`cooldown`、`command_active`、`tts_active`、`bridge_busy`、`invalid_event`、`recorder_error`；recorder error 会释放 `bridge_busy`。
- 新增 `scripts/wake_command_bridge_demo.py`：默认 `events=3`、`interval_seconds=0.5`、`cooldown_seconds=2.5`，预期只 `command_starts=1`，后续 event 因 cooldown 被 suppress。
- 新增 `docs/V1.2D_C_WAKE_COMMAND_BRIDGE_VALIDATION.md`，记录桥接层目标、状态机、fake 验证、demo 命令、风险和下一步。
- 新增单测覆盖 accepted/cooldown/cooldown 后恢复、command_active、tts_active、disabled、recorder_error、reset、fake starter 只接收 accepted event、demo help/dry-run/default/simulated blocks。
- 未修改 `voice_overlay.py`、`wake_loop_service.py`、`wake_word_service.py`、conversation/TTS/LLM/reply pipeline、openwakeword adapter、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、requirements；未写 `E:\DataBase`；未打开真实麦克风；未下载模型；未训练中文“贾维斯”模型。
- 下一步 V1.2D-D：只读分析 `voice_overlay.py` 的 command recording 入口，设计 feature flag + 最小接入点；仍不直接替换 STT 文本唤醒。

### V1.2D-B Wake Engine safety validation 记录（2026-05-03）

- `scripts/wake_engine_demo.py` 新增 `--safety-check`、`--repeat`、`--gap-seconds`，重复执行 adapter start / short run / stop，并输出每轮 frames、raw/coalesced/suppressed 统计和 `status_after_stop`。
- `OpenWakeWordAdapter.status()` 区分 `model_loaded` 与 `ready`；模型加载后即保持 `model_loaded=True`，运行错误只影响 `ready/error`，错误摘要增加基础 secret redaction。
- 单测新增覆盖 start 前 stop 幂等、普通异常释放 fake stream、`KeyboardInterrupt` 释放 fake stream、callback 只触发 coalesced event、两轮 fake run 后不残留 `running=True`、fake safety-check 两轮输出。
- 新增 `docs/V1.2D_B_WAKE_ENGINE_SAFETY_VALIDATION.md`，并更新 V1.2 design、V1.2D adapter doc、README。
- 真人 safety-check 已通过：`--engine openwakeword --duration-seconds 10 --device 0 --debug --cooldown-seconds 2.5 --safety-check --repeat 2 --gap-seconds 1`。
- 关键结果：round 2 `frames=123`、`raw_detections=17`、`coalesced_events=3`、`suppressed_detections=14`、`status_after_stop running=false ready=false model_loaded=true error=-`；最终 `all_rounds_completed=true`、`microphone_released=true`、`errors=0`。
- 未修改 `voice_overlay.py`、`wake_loop_service.py`、`wake_word_service.py`、conversation/TTS/LLM/reply pipeline、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、requirements；未写 `E:\DataBase`；未下载模型；未训练中文“贾维斯”模型。
- 后续已进入 V1.2D-C 并完成 wake event -> fake command starter 模拟桥接；真实 command recorder、TTS pause/cooldown 和 `stt_text` fallback 仍需后续主链路设计/人工验证。

### V1.2D-A OpenWakeWordAdapter harness 记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/openwakeword_adapter.py`：`OpenWakeWordDependencyStatus`、`check_openwakeword_dependencies()` 和 `OpenWakeWordAdapter`。
- adapter 模块 import 本身不依赖 openwakeword；依赖检查和 runtime 都是 optional import，不打开麦克风、不加载模型、不下载模型。
- `OpenWakeWordAdapter.start()` 加载 numpy、openWakeWord model 和 sounddevice `InputStream` factory；`run_for_duration()` 才打开 stream，结束或异常时 finally 释放并 `stop()`。
- adapter 复用 `WakeEvent`、`WakeEngineStatus`、`WakeEventCoalescer`、`WakeEventStats`；只对 coalesced event 调用 callback，真实 label 保存在 `WakeEvent.label`，显示名保存在 `wake_phrase`。
- `scripts/wake_engine_demo.py --check-install` 已改为调用 adapter dependency check；真实监听路径优先走 `OpenWakeWordAdapter.run_for_duration()`；`--help` / `--dry-run` 仍不加载模型、不打开麦克风。
- 新增 `docs/V1.2D_OPENWAKEWORD_ADAPTER_VALIDATION.md`，记录 adapter 生命周期、demo 关系、安全边界和 V1.2D-B 前置检查。
- 新增单测覆盖缺依赖不崩溃、依赖模拟齐全、start/stop 幂等、fake model/audio stream、per-label cooldown、`--help` / `--check-install` / `--dry-run`。
- 未修改 `voice_overlay.py`、`wake_loop_service.py`、`wake_word_service.py`、conversation/TTS/LLM/reply pipeline、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、requirements；未写 `E:\DataBase`；未下载模型；未训练中文“贾维斯”模型。
- 下一步 V1.2D-B：验证麦克风释放、wake event -> command recorder 切换、TTS 播放期间 pause/cooldown、adapter error fallback 到 `stt_text`。

### V1.2C WakeEngine service abstraction 记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/wake_engine_service.py`：`WakeEvent`、`WakeEngineStatus`、`WakeEventStats`、`WakeEventCoalescer`、`FakeWakeEngine` 和轻量 `WakeEngine` Protocol。
- `WakeEventCoalescer` 是 per-label cooldown：同一 label 在 cooldown 内只接受第一次 detection，不同 label 不互相抑制；统计 `raw_detections`、`coalesced_events`、`suppressed_detections`，支持 `reset()`。
- `FakeWakeEngine` 不依赖麦克风或 openWakeWord，支持 start/stop/status、fake event emission、cooldown 测试和 error simulation，供 V1.2D 接入前测试使用。
- `scripts/wake_engine_demo.py` 已复用 service 层 `WakeEventCoalescer` / `WakeEventStats` / `WakeEvent`；保留 `--help`、`--check-install`、`--dry-run`、`--list-devices`、`--cooldown-seconds`、`--no-coalesce`。
- 新增 `docs/V1.2C_WAKE_ENGINE_SERVICE_DESIGN.md`，并更新 V1.2A/V1.2B 文档与 README，明确本阶段不接入 `voice_overlay.py`。
- 未新增 `openwakeword_adapter.py`；adapter 边界留到 V1.2D 前安全验证阶段。
- 未修改 `voice_overlay.py`、`wake_loop_service.py`、`wake_word_service.py`、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、requirements；未新增依赖；未写 `E:\DataBase`；未下载模型；未训练中文“贾维斯”模型。
- 下一步 V1.2D 前置：adapter optional import、安全状态、麦克风释放、命令录音切换、TTS 后 cooldown、自唤醒防护和 STT text fallback rollback。

### V1.2B-1 openWakeWord Event Coalescing 记录（2026-05-03）

- `scripts/wake_engine_demo.py` 增加 `--cooldown-seconds`（默认 2.5）和 `--no-coalesce`；默认按 label 做 per-label cooldown。
- 结束 summary 新增 `raw_detections`、`coalesced_events`、`suppressed_detections`、`cooldown_seconds`；raw detection 仍代表帧级 score 命中，不等于用户喊话次数。
- 用户真人验证：`openwakeword 0.6.0`、`onnxruntime 1.23.2`、`sounddevice 0.5.5`、`numpy 2.2.6` 可用；`pyaudio` / `PyAudioWPatch` 未安装但不影响 sounddevice backend。
- 设备：`--list-devices` 共 12 个 input device；继续用 device 0，因为小黄历史一直用 device 0。
- 模型：初次缺 `alexa_v0.1.onnx`，用户执行 `openwakeword.utils.download_models()` 后默认模型可用；本仓库未提交模型。
- 真人结果：30 秒 demo `listening=true`；英文 `hey_jarvis` 多次成功，score 最高接近 0.998；静默测试 `frames=748, detections=0`；重复唤醒 `frames=373, detections=29`。
- 结论：openWakeWord 本机可行性通过，但 `wake_phrase=贾维斯` 只是显示名，真实 label 是英文 `hey_jarvis`；中文“贾维斯”模型未完成，不接入 `voice_overlay.py`。
- 下一步 V1.2C：`WakeEngine` abstraction + adapter + event coalescing + `stt_text` fallback，先验证麦克风释放、命令录音切换和 TTS 后 cooldown。

### V1.2B openWakeWord 独立 Demo 记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 `scripts/wake_engine_demo.py`：独立 openWakeWord demo harness，支持 `--help`、`--check-install`、`--dry-run`、`--list-devices`、短时监听参数、score/event 输出路径。
- 新增 `docs/V1.2B_OPENWAKEWORD_DEMO_VALIDATION.md`：记录本机依赖、设备、限制和下一步真人体验方法。
- 当前 `F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe` 环境已由用户补齐：`openwakeword 0.6.0`、`onnxruntime 1.23.2`、`numpy 2.2.6` 和 `sounddevice 0.5.5` 已可用；`pyaudio` / `pyaudiowpatch` 未安装。
- `--check-install` 设计为 exit code 0；当前已返回 `openwakeword_installed=true` / `ready_for_realtime_demo=true`。
- `--list-devices` 已能通过 `sounddevice` 列出 12 个 input device；stdout/stderr 设置 errors=replace，避免 Windows 设备名特殊字符导致 GBK 编码崩溃。
- 本阶段未修改 `voice_overlay.py`、`wake_loop_service.py`、`wake_word_service.py`、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、配置主链路，仓库未新增依赖，未提交模型文件，未训练中文“贾维斯”模型，未写 `E:\DataBase`。
- 后续 V1.2C 前建议：继续用 `wake_engine_demo.py --check-install`、`--list-devices`、短时 `--duration-seconds 30 --debug --cooldown-seconds 2.5` 记录 score/CPU/设备占用，再抽象 WakeEngine service。

### V1.2A Wake Engine 设计记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 docs-only 设计：`docs/V1.2_WAKE_ENGINE_DESIGN.md`。
- 目标：解决当前 STT 文本匹配唤醒不灵敏、用户需要喊多次的问题，规划专用 Wake Word / KWS 引擎。
- 数据库 API `127.0.0.1:8765` 未运行，按要求只读 `E:\DataBase` curated 文件和本地 raw 项目，未重建索引，未写数据库。
- 本地参考项目：`openWakeWord`、`Wake-Word`、`FunASR`；未找到本地 `wyoming-openwakeword` / `sherpa-onnx` / `mycroft-precise` 独立仓库，已用官方资料补充。
- 推荐路线：V1.2 优先 openWakeWord 独立 demo + adapter 抽象，保留 STT 文本匹配 fallback；Porcupine 只作体验标杆/可选方案，wyoming-openwakeword 只借鉴 server 架构，sherpa-onnx / FunASR KWS 做中长期对比，Precise 只研究。
- 规划新增但本阶段不实现：`src/xiaohuang/wake_engine_service.py`、`src/xiaohuang/openwakeword_adapter.py`、`scripts/wake_engine_demo.py`，后续可选 `scripts/wake_engine_server.py`。
- 明确 V1.2A 不修改 `voice_overlay.py`、wake/session/TTS/LLM router、控制面板、托盘、PowerShell、配置代码，不下载模型，不训练模型，不新增依赖。
- `E:\OpenSourceWakeTest\wake_projects_install_report.md` 不存在；待 V1.2B 独立实验补充安装和麦克风验证结果。

### V1.1.4D 设计记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 docs-only 设计：`docs/V1.1.4D_STATUS_CONTROL_PANEL_DESIGN.md`。
- 目标：解决托盘启动后用户看不见 readiness 的问题，明确显示 STT server、health/model_loaded、voice_overlay、config 摘要和 `can_wake_now`。
- 推荐后续实现：`scripts/control_panel.py` + `src/xiaohuang/status_control_service.py`，可选 `status_types.py`。
- 控制面板应复用 `launch_control_service.py` 的进程检测、health check、readiness、启停命令，不复制 PowerShell 解析逻辑。
- 技术方案推荐 Tkinter，暂不引入 PySide6 / Qt / WebView / Tauri。
- 数据库参考：code-assets-global-index、code-asset-reuse-rules、launch-control-readiness-pattern、operation-lock snippet、desktop assistant adapter、settings-ui-config-validation、backend-healthcheck-error-envelope。
- 明确 V1.1.5 后续再规划后台常驻、STT server 常驻、暂停/恢复监听、完全退出和开机自启。
- 本阶段未修改 `.py` / `.ps1` / `.json` / `.yaml` / `src` / `scripts` / `tests`，未写 `E:\DataBase`。

### V1.1.4D-A 实现记录（2026-05-03）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/status_control_service.py`：聚合 `launch_control_service` 的进程检测、STT health、配置摘要，返回 `ControlPanelStatus`。
- 新增 `scripts/control_panel.py`：Tkinter 基础控制面板，支持 `--config` 和 `--refresh-interval`，显示总状态、STT/overlay/health、助手名、唤醒词、LLM provider、TTS 和 config path。
- 控制面板支持启动/停止/重启、刷新状态、打开设置、打开日志目录；操作在后台线程执行，关闭窗口不停止小黄。
- `scripts/tray_app.py` 菜单新增“打开控制面板”，原有启动/停止/重启/退出托盘语义不变。
- 未修改 PowerShell、`voice_overlay.py`、wake/session/TTS/LLM 主链路，未新增依赖，未写 `E:\DataBase`。
- 自动验证：315 tests OK、compileall OK、control_panel/tray_app/settings_ui/voice_overlay help OK；人工验证仍需用户从托盘打开控制面板并真实启动/唤醒/重启/停止。

### V1.1.4D-A readiness 修复记录（2026-05-03）

- 修复 blocker：UI 已显示 READY 时，启动/重启操作仍返回 `timeout_voice_overlay_missing` 的不一致。
- 根因：`voice_overlay.py` 命令行分类没有完整规范化路径形式，且启动/重启等待超时后没有用控制面板最终 READY 状态兜底。
- `launch_control_service.classify_process_command_line()` 现在支持绝对路径、相对 `scripts\...`、正斜杠、带引号和 `pythonw.exe` 形式；其他项目绝对路径同名脚本仍不计入。
- `wait_until_ready()` 增加可注入 compact poll 文本：`readiness poll stt=True overlay=True health=ready model_loaded=True`，单测不写真实日志。
- `status_control_service` 启动/重启在 wait timeout 后会重读 `build_status()`；若 `can_wake_now=True`，返回成功，避免 READY 后误弹未就绪错误。
- READY 条件统一为 STT 进程 + overlay 进程 + `/health` ready（`status=ready` 或 `model_loaded=True`）。
- 未修改 PowerShell、`voice_overlay.py`、wake/session/TTS/LLM router，未新增依赖，未写 `E:\DataBase`。
- 自动验证：315 tests OK、compileall OK、control_panel/tray_app/settings_ui/voice_overlay help OK。

### V1.1.4D-B 控制面板流畅性修复记录（2026-05-03）

- 根因确认：`scripts/control_panel.py` 的周期刷新原先在 Tkinter 主线程调用 `build_status()`，会触发 PowerShell 进程检测和 STT `/health` 网络请求，导致拖动/点击卡顿。
- 修复：新增 `StatusRefreshController`，周期刷新、手动刷新和操作后刷新都改为后台线程采集状态，再用 `root.after(0, ...)` 回主线程渲染。
- 防堆叠：状态中新增 `refresh_in_progress`、`pending_refresh`、`refresh_generation`、`last_status`；旧 generation 的刷新结果不会覆盖较新的操作/READY 状态。
- 启动/停止/重启仍在后台执行；操作 worker 结束后顺便采集 `final_status`，READY 时继续消除陈旧 `timeout_voice_overlay_missing` 弹窗。
- 关闭窗口安全：`closed=True` 后刷新结果不再更新 Tk 控件，关闭时递增 generation 丢弃旧结果。
- 真人复测发现 D-B 仍有 READY 界面 + `timeout_voice_overlay_missing` 错误弹窗竞态；后续修复为 operation completion result 优先：worker 用短暂 grace window 采集 READY `final_status`，主线程只按该 final_status 决定启动/重启弹窗，operation completion pending 时普通 refresh apply 会被跳过。
- 未修改 PowerShell、`voice_overlay.py`、wake/session/TTS/LLM router，未新增依赖，未写 `E:\DataBase`。
- 数据库参考：读取 code assets global index、reuse rules、`launch-control-readiness-pattern.asset.json`、operation-lock snippet、desktop assistant adapter；本机数据库 API `127.0.0.1:8765` 未运行，改为按要求只读文件。
- 自动验证：`F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe`（Python 3.10.20）下 334 tests OK、compileall OK、control_panel/tray_app/settings_ui/voice_overlay help OK；此前 `.venv` fallback 也通过基础 D-B 命令。

### V1.1.3C 验证收尾记录（2026-05-02）

- Settings UI 可打开，6 个 tab 齐全：Wake / Assistant / LLM / TTS / Conversation / Advanced。
- 人工保存 `assistant.display_name = 贾维斯测试` 后发现 blocker：Advanced 页 `post_response_cooldown=None` 被保存成字符串 `"None"`。
- 根因：Tkinter Entry 初始化时 `str(None)` 显示为 `"None"`，保存层未把 `"None"` / 空字符串规范成 JSON `null`。
- 修复：`scripts/settings_ui.py` 将 None 显示为空；`settings_config_file_service.normalize_ui_inputs()` 将 `overlay.post_response_cooldown` 的空值/`None`/`null` 规范为 `None`，数字字符串转 float。
- 已修复测试配置：`%USERPROFILE%\.xiaohuang\config_settings_ui_test.json` 中 `overlay.post_response_cooldown` 已恢复为 JSON `null`。
- 真实启动验证显示 `wake.phrases=贾维斯`、LLM persona、TTS、session exit 都生效；日志有 `source=llm`、`Session ended: reason=exit_phrase`，无 Traceback/ERROR/TypeError。
- 追加小修：浮窗内部状态文案不再硬编码“小黄”，会使用 `assistant.display_name` 和第一个 `wake.phrases`；默认仍保持“小黄”。
- 最终真人验证已通过：Settings UI 保存后的 `config_settings_ui_test.json` 可真实启动小黄；“贾维斯”可唤醒，`assistant.display_name` 生效，问“你是谁”保持贾维斯身份，TTS 有声音，session exit 正常。
- 日志检查无 Traceback / ERROR / HTTPError / TypeError / UnboundLocalError。
- 详细记录见 `docs/V1.1.3C_SETTINGS_UI_VALIDATION.md`。

### V1.1.4A 设计记录（2026-05-02）

- 目标：让小黄从手动命令启动演进为可由托盘管理的桌面常驻助手。
- 本阶段只设计，不写托盘代码，不改 `.py/.ps1/.json/.yaml` 运行文件。
- 设计覆盖：启动/停止/重启小黄、打开 Settings UI、打开 logs 目录、状态显示、安全退出、进程识别、配置路径、日志、风险和验收。
- 推荐入口：未来新增 `scripts/tray_app.py`；可选服务 `process_status_service.py` / `launch_control_service.py`。
- 详细设计见 `docs/V1.1.4_TRAY_LAUNCH_CONTROL_DESIGN.md`。

### V1.1.4B 实现记录（2026-05-02）

- 新增 `scripts/tray_app.py`，使用 pystray + Pillow 创建最小托盘入口。
- 菜单只包含：打开设置、打开日志目录、关于/状态、退出托盘。
- `打开设置` 调用当前 Python 运行 `scripts/settings_ui.py --config <config_path>`，不阻塞托盘主线程。
- `打开日志目录` 创建并打开 `logs/`。
- `退出托盘` 只停止托盘图标，不调用 `stop_xiaohuang.ps1`，不停止 STT/overlay。
- 新增依赖：`pystray>=0.19.5`、`Pillow>=10.0`。
- 自动验证：267 tests OK、compileall OK、tray/settings/overlay help OK。
- 启动 smoke：`tray_app.py --config config_settings_ui_test.json` 可启动为常驻进程。
- 最终真人验证已通过：托盘图标出现、右键菜单打开、打开 Settings UI、读取 `config_settings_ui_test.json`、打开 `logs/`、关于/状态、退出托盘均正常。
- 边界验证通过：V1.1.4B 没有启动/停止/重启小黄；退出托盘不会停止 STT server / voice_overlay；未影响 voice_overlay / wake / session / TTS / LLM router 主链路。
- 详细记录见 `docs/V1.1.4B_TRAY_VALIDATION.md`。

### V1.1.4C 实现记录（2026-05-02）

- 新增 `src/xiaohuang/launch_control_service.py`，封装 PowerShell 启停命令构造、重启顺序、日志目录、进程检测和状态摘要。
- `scripts/tray_app.py` 菜单新增：启动小黄、停止小黄、重启小黄。
- 启动小黄会先检测 STT server / voice_overlay；只有二者都存在才提示“已在运行”，避免重复启动。
- 启动命令会传递当前托盘 `--config` 到 `start_xiaohuang.ps1 -ConfigPath <config_path>`，避免丢失 `config_settings_ui_test.json`。
- 停止命令调用 `stop_xiaohuang.ps1 -StopSttServer`；退出托盘仍只退出托盘程序，不停止小黄。
- 本阶段未修改 PowerShell、voice_overlay、wake、session、TTS、LLM router，也未新增依赖。
- 自动验证：274 tests OK、compileall OK、tray_app/settings_ui/voice_overlay help OK；托盘进程受控启动 5 秒 smoke 后按 PID 停止，未触发小黄启动/停止菜单。
- Blocker 修复：用户发现托盘启动后只有 `voice_overlay.py`、没有 `stt_server.py`，`/health` 连接拒绝；根因是启动防重复逻辑用 `any_running`，overlay-only partial 状态被误判为已运行并跳过完整启动。
- 修复策略：新增 `ProcessStatus.is_fully_running` / `is_partial` 和 `build_start_sequence_for_status()`；partial/broken 状态下“启动小黄”先调用 `stop_xiaohuang.ps1 -StopSttServer` 清理，再调用 `start_xiaohuang.ps1 -ConfigPath <config_path>` 完整拉起链路。
- PowerShell 调用 blocker：`powershell.exe -File start_xiaohuang.ps1` 会在 dot-source `run_env.ps1` 时解析示例命令里的 `&` / 引号失败；同一 argv list 用 `pwsh.exe` 可正常拉起 STT server 和 overlay。
- 修复策略：启停命令仍返回 argv list、仍用 `-File`、仍 `shell=False`，但优先解析 `pwsh.exe`，找不到才回退 `powershell.exe`；不修改 `start_xiaohuang.ps1` / `stop_xiaohuang.ps1` / `run_env.ps1`。
- Readiness 修复：启动/重启不再只看 PowerShell returncode；必须等待 STT server 进程、voice_overlay 进程和 `/health` ready/model_loaded。
- 防重复点击：`scripts/tray_app.py` 新增 `OperationGuard`，启动/停止/重启同一时间只允许一个操作线程；重复点击只提示当前操作进行中。
- 停止确认：停止命令完成后等待 STT server / voice_overlay 都消失；超时提示查看 `logs/tray_app.log`。
- Operation release 修复：用户确认没有残留 pwsh/powershell 启停脚本进程，但托盘仍显示“启动操作进行中”；修复为 `_execute_guarded_operation()` 统一 acquire/release，所有 success/error/timeout/exception 路径都在 finally 中释放，并记录 `operation=<name> release reason=<...>`。
- 启动命令改为 async 发出后直接 wait readiness；readiness 成功即可释放 busy flag，不再等待 `start_xiaohuang.ps1` 进程完全退出作为唯一成功条件。

## 历史阶段

<details>
<summary>V0.9.1 — DeepSeek 单句对话原型（收尾稳定版）</summary>

- Purpose: XiaoHuang V0.9.1 is a stabilization patch over V0.9 — DeepSeek error handling, LLM reply cleaning, TTS/LLM combination stability, artifact protection, and docs.
- V0.9.1 scope: no new features, no backend foundation, no multi-turn memory, no tool execution.
- V0.9.1 changes:
  - LLM reply execution claim filter (blocks "我已经打开"/"已下载"/"已执行" etc.)
  - Expanded tool request keywords (17 categories)
  - Overlay result displays fallback source note when DeepSeek unavailable
  - Improved shutdown: exception handler checks stop_event before sleeping
  - No-key startup message only in debug mode, not every round
  - API key never logged or included in reply text
  - Reply source tracked and displayed: llm/rule/rule_fallback_no_key/rule_fallback_error/tool_unavailable
- Key files: `scripts/voice_overlay.py`, `scripts/wake_loop.py`, `scripts/test_wake_text.py`, `src/xiaohuang/llm_reply_service.py`, `src/xiaohuang/reply_service.py`, `src/xiaohuang/tts_service.py`, `src/xiaohuang/wake_word_service.py`, `src/xiaohuang/wake_loop_service.py`.
- Current environment: use `F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe`; recording works with `device 0`; ModelScope cache is `F:\for_xiaohuang\models\modelscope`; ffmpeg is installed through `winget` and available on PATH.
- Startup/test: dot-source `.\scripts\run_env.ps1`; set `PYTHONPATH=E:\Projects\xiaohuang\src`; run `& "F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe" -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- Last completed: V0.9.1 stabilization — 81 tests pass (9 new), compileall clean, --help verified.
- Overlay command: `& "F:\for_xiaohuang\conda310\python.exe" scripts\voice_overlay.py --device 0 --debug`.
- API key boundary: never commit or write `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; use environment variables only.
- Wake trap: V0.9.1 wake is short-recording + STT text matching, not openWakeWord/FunASR KWS.
- Still unfinished at V0.9.1: real KWS model, multi-turn dialogue, system tray, installer, desktop-assistant integrations.
